Now from Thy cheeks has vanished\r\n\nTheir color, once so fair;\r\n\nFrom Thy red lips is banished\r\n\nThe splendor that was there.\r\n\nGrim Death, with cruel rigor,\r\n\nHath robbed Thee of Thy life;\r\n\nThus Thou has lost Thy vigor,\r\n\nThy strength, in this sad strife.\r\n\n\r\n\n4. My burden in Thy Passion,\r\n\nLord, Thou hast borne for me,\r\n\nFor it was my transgression\r\n\nWhich brought this woe on thee.\r\n\nI cast me down before Thee,\r\n\nWrath were my rightful lot;\r\n\nHave mercy, I implore Thee;\r\n\nRedeemer, spurn me not!\r\n\n\r\n\n5.
