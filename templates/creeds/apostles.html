<h3>The Apostles' Creed</h3>
<p>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; Who was
    conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary; Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and
    buried; He descended into hell; The third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on
    the right hand of God the Father Almighty; From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Christian Church, the communion of saints; The forgiveness of sins; The
    resurrection of the body; And the life everlasting. Amen.</p>
