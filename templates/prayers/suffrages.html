    <p>O Lord, <br><strong>have mercy upon us.</strong></p>
    <p>O Christ, <br><strong>have mercy upon us.</strong></p>
    <p>O Lord, <br><strong>have mercy upon us.</strong></p>
    <p>Our Father, who art in heaven; Hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation. <br><strong>But deliver us from evil.</strong></p>
    
    <p>I said; O Lord, be merciful unto me;<br><strong>Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.</strong><br>
    Return, O Lord, how long?<br><strong>And let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants.</strong><br>
    Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us;<br><strong>According as we hope in Thee.</strong><br>
    Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness;<br><strong>And let Thy saints shout for joy.</strong><br>
    O Lord, save our rulers;<br><strong>Let the King hear us when we call.</strong><br>
    Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance;<br><strong>Feed them also, and lift them up for ever.</strong><br>
    Remember Thy congregation;<br><strong>Which Thou hast purchased of old.</strong><br>
    Peace be within thy walls;<br><strong>And prosperity within thy palaces.</strong><br>
    Let us pray for our absent brethren;<br><strong>O Thou, our God, save Thy servants that trust in Thee.</strong><br>
    Let us pray for the broken-hearted and the captives;<br><strong>Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</strong><br>
    Send them help from the Sanctuary.<br><strong>And strengthen them out of Zion.</strong><br>
    Hear my prayer, O LORD;<br><strong>And let my cry come unto Thee.</strong></p>

    <p>Lord, hear my voice:<br><strong>Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.</strong></p>
    <p>If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities:<br><strong>Lord, who shall stand?</strong></p>
    <p>But there is forgiveness with Thee:<br><strong>That Thou mayest be feared.</strong></p>
    <p>I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait:<br><strong>And in His Word do I hope.</strong></p>
    <p>My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning:<br><strong>I say, more than they that watch for the morning.</strong></p>
    <p>Let Israel hope in the Lord:<br><strong>For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.</strong></p>
    <p>And He shall redeem Israel:<br><strong>From all his iniquities.</strong></p>

    <p>For I acknowledge my transgressions:<br><strong>And my sin is ever before me.</strong></p>
    <p>Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned and done this evil in Thy sight:<br><strong>That Thou mightest be justified when Thou speakest, and be clear when Thou judgest.</strong></p>
    <p>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity:<br><strong>And in sin did my mother conceive me.</strong></p>
    <p>Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts:<br><strong>And in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</strong></p>
