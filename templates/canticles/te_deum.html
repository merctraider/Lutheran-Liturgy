<h4>Te Deum</h4>
{{ audio: matins-te-deum.mp3 }}
<p>
We praise Thee O God, we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord.<br>
All the earth doth worship Thee, the Father Everlasting.<br>
To Thee all the angels cry aloud, the heavens and all the powers therein;<br>
To Thee cherubim and seraphim continually do cry;<br>
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth;<br>
Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of Thy glory.<br>
The glorious company of the Apostles praise Thee<br>
The goodly fellowship of the prophets praise Thee;<br>
The noble army of martyrs praise Thee;<br>
The holy Church though all the world doth acknowledge Thee;<br>
The Father of an infinite majesty; Thine adorable true and only Son,<br>
Also the Holy Ghost, the Comforter.<br>
Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ.<br>
Thou are the everlasting Son of the Father.<br>
When Thou tookest upon Thee to deleiver man;<br>
Thou didst humble Thyself to be born of a virgin.<br>
When Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death,<br>
Thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.<br>
Thou sittest at the right hand of God<br>
In the glory of the Father.<br>
We believe that thou shalt come<br>
To be our judge.<br>
We therefore pray Thee to help Thy servants,<br>
Whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious blood.<br>
Make them to be numbered with Thy saints<br>
In glory everlasting.<br>
O Lord, save Thy people and bless Thine heritage.<br>
Govern them and lift them up forever.<br>
Day by day we magnify Thee,<br>
And we worship Thy name ever, world without end.<br>
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin,<br>
O Lord have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us,<br>
O Lord, let Thy mercy be upon us, as our trust is in Thee.<br>
O Lord, in Thee have I trusted; let me never be confounded.
