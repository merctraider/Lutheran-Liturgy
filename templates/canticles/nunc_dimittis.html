<h4>Nunc Dimittis</h4>
<p>
1. Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word:<br>
2. For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people;<br>
3. A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.
</p>
<p>
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost:<br>
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
