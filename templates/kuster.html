        <!-- First Article -->
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Through the words of our Small Catechism, let us consider our God and how He has revealed Himself and His will toward us.</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In the First Article of the Apostles' Creed, we confess and pray: "I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> I believe that God has made me and all creatures; that He has given me my body and soul, eyes, ears, and all my members, my reason and all my senses, and still preserves them; also clothing and shoes, meat and drink, house and home, wife and children, fields, cattle, and all my goods; that He richly and daily provides me with all that I need to support this body and life; that He defends me against all danger, and guards and protects me from all evil; and all this purely out of fatherly, divine goodness and mercy, without any merit or worthiness in me; for all which it is my duty to thank and praise, to serve and obey Him. This is most certainly true.</p>
        
        <!-- The Ten Commandments -->
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Let us examine how God has commanded us "to thank and praise, to serve and obey Him."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> He says in His First Commandment, "You shall have no other gods."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear, love, and trust in God above all things.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> How is this done with regard to the use of His name?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In His Second Commandment, the Lord says, "You shall not misuse the Name of your God."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not curse, swear, use witchcraft, lie or deceive by His name; but call upon it in every trouble, pray, praise, and give thanks.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Therefore, what does He command?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> His Third Commandment is, "You shall sanctify the Sabbath Day." Since St. Paul tells us in his Epistle to the Colossians that the Sabbath Day was a shadow that pointed to the Christ and the rest He would provide for us, in the New Testament era we understand this Commandment to say, "You shall sanctify the Day of Rest."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not despise preaching and His word; but hold it sacred, and gladly hear and learn it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> The Lord next commands you to fear, love, and trust in Him above all things by a right relationship with your fellow man. What does He command you in the Fourth Commandment?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> The Fourth Commandment tells us, "You shall honor your father and your mother."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not despise our parents and masters, nor provoke them to anger; but give them honor, serve and obey them, and hold them in love and esteem.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What about people in general, even those under your authority or of a lower station in life than you?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> "You shall not murder," our Lord says in His Fifth Commandment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not hurt nor harm our neighbor in his body; but help and befriend him in every bodily need.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> In what other ways are we to honor God in relation to our neighbor?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In the Sixth Commandment, we are told, "You shall not commit adultery."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may lead a chaste and decent life in word and deed, and each love and honor his spouse.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Thus, God protects our neighbor's body in every way; what about his possessions?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In the Seventh Commandment, we are told, "You shall not steal."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not take our neighbor's money or goods, nor get them by false ware or dealing; but help him to improve and protect his property and business.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Does God protect only physical things?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In the Eighth Commandment, He says of His people, "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not deceitfully belie, betray, slander, nor defame our neighbor; but defend him, speak well of him, and put the best construction on everything.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Are only actions sinful?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> No, in the Ninth Commandment, the Lord tells us, "You shall not covet your neighbor's house."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not craftily seek to get our neighbor's inheritance or house, nor obtain it by a show of right; but help and be of service to him in keeping it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> For what else must we not have a sinful desire?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In the Tenth Commandment, the Lord says, "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, manservant, maidservant, animals, or anything that is his."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> We should fear and love God, that we may not estrange, force or entice away from our neighbor his wife, servants, or cattle; but urge them to stay and do their duty.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does God say about all of these Commandments?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> He says: "I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, Who visits the sin of the fathers upon their children who hate Me, to the third and fourth generation; but to those who love Me and keep My commandments, I do good for a thousand generations."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> God threatens to punish all that transgress these commandments. Therefore we should fear His wrath, and not act contrary to them. But He promises grace and every blessing to all that keep these commandments. Therefore we should also love and trust in Him, and willingly do according to His commandments.</p>
        
        <!-- Second Article -->
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> How, then, shall we who cannot properly obey all these Commandments ever have God's mercy and salvation?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> In the Second Article of the Apostles Creed, we confess and pray: "And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> What does this mean?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature, purchased and won me from all sins, from death and from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with His holy precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death, that I may be His own, and live under Him in His kingdom, and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, even as He is risen from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity. This is most certainly true.</p>

<!-- The Lord's Prayer -->
<div class="{{ section_class }}">
    <h3 class="{{ section_title_class }}">The Lord's Prayer</h3>
    <div class="{{ section_body_class }}">
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Since God has had such mercy on us, what does He invite us to do?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Our Lord Jesus invites us to pray, "Our Father, who art in Heaven." "God would by these words tenderly invite us to believe that He is our true Father, and that we are His true children, so that we may with all boldness and confidence ask Him, as dear children ask their dear father."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> With such an invitation, what do we pray?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> First, we pray of our Father, "Hallowed be Thy Name." "God's name is indeed holy in itself; but we pray in this petition that it may be holy among us also." God's Name is kept holy "When the word of God is taught in its truth and purity, and we as the children of God also lead a holy life according to it. This grant us, dear Father in heaven. But he that teaches and lives otherwise than God's word teaches, profanes the name of God among us. From this preserve us, Heavenly Father."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Second, we pray, "Thy Kingdom come." "The kingdom of God comes indeed without our prayer, of itself; but we pray in this petition that it may come unto us also." God's kingdom comes "When our Heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so that by His grace we believe His holy word and lead a godly life, here in time, and hereafter in eternity."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Third, we pray, "Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven." "The good and gracious will of God is done indeed without our prayer; but we pray in this petition that it may be done among us also." God's will is done "When God breaks and hinders every evil counsel and will which would not let us hallow God's name nor let His kingdom come, such as the will of the devil, the world, and our flesh; but strengthens and preserves us steadfast in His word and faith unto our end. This is His gracious and good will."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Fourth, we pray, "Give us this day our daily bread." "God gives daily bread indeed without our prayer, also to all the wicked; but we pray in this petition that He would lead us to know it, and to receive our daily bread with thanksgiving." Daily bread includes "Everything that belongs to the support and wants of the body, such as food, drink, clothing, shoes, house, home, field, cattle, money, goods, a pious spouse, pious children, pious servants, pious and faithful rulers, good government, good weather, peace, health, discipline, honor, good friends, faithful neighbors, and the like."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Fifth, we pray, "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." "We pray in this petition that our Father in heaven would not look upon our sins, nor on their account deny our prayer; for we are worthy of none of the things for which we pray, neither have we deserved them; but that He would grant them all to us by grace; for we daily sin much and indeed deserve nothing but punishment: so will we also heartily forgive and readily do good to those who sin against us."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Sixth, we pray, "And lead us not into temptation." "God indeed tempts no one; but we pray in this petition that God would guard and keep us, so that the devil, the world and our flesh may not deceive us, nor seduce us into misbelief, despair, and other great shame and vice; and though we be assailed by them, that still we may finally overcome, and obtain the victory."</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Seventh, we pray, "But ✠ deliver us from evil." "We pray in this petition, as the sum of all, that our Father in heaven would deliver us from every evil of body and soul, property and honor, and finally, when our last hour has come, grant us a blessed end, and graciously take us from this vale of tears to Himself in heaven."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Are we confident that our prayer will be heard?</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Our prayer ends with, "Amen." This means "That I should be certain that these petitions are acceptable to our Father in heaven and heard; for He Himself has commanded us so to pray, and has promised to hear us. Amen, Amen, that is, yea, yea, it shall be so."</p>

We pray Thee so to reveal to us Thy Word, our Lord Jesus Christ that, through His dwelling in our hearts, we may by Thy grace be made ready to receive Thy blessing on all the fruits of the earth and whatsoever pertains to our bodily need; through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Küster:</strong> Finally, let us pray for all those things for which our Lord would have us ask, saying:</p>
        
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Our Father, Who art in Heaven: Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and Lead us not into temptation, but ✠ Deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
