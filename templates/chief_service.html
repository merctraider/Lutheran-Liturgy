        <p>Dearly beloved: Forasmuch as we purpose to come to the Holy Supper of our, Lord Jesus Christ, it becometh us diligently to examine ourselves, as St. Paul exhorteth us. For this holy Sacrament hath been instituted for the special comfort and strengthening of those who humbly confess their sins and hunger and thirst after righteousness.</p>
        <p>But if we thus examine ourselves, we shall find nothing in us but sin and death, from which we can in no wise set ourselves free. Therefore our Lord Jesus Christ hath had mercy upon us and hath taken upon Himself our nature, that so He might fulfill for us the whole will and Law of God and for us and for our deliverance suffer death and all that we by our sins have deserved. And to the end that we should the more confidently believe this and be strengthened by our faith in a cheerful obedience to His holy will, He hath instituted the holy Sacrament of His supper, in which He feedeth us with His body and giveth us to drink of His blood.</p>
        <p>Therefore, whoso eateth of this bread and drinketh of this cup, firmly believing the words of Christ, dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him, and hath eternal life.</p>
        <p>We should do this also in remembrance of Him, showing His death, that He was delivered for our offenses and raised again for our justification, and rendering unto Him most hearty thanks for the same, take up our cross and follow Him, and, according to His commandment, love one another even as He hath loved us. For we are all one bread and one body, even as we are all partakers of this one bread and drink of this one cup.</p>
